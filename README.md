Hey, welcome to this project!

This project was made in may of 2024. At the time, the majority of my recent experience was in Java as I was taking AP Compsci. 
I made this with a lot of love in my heart, and it was fun to work on. I think it came out quite nicely. 
Sorry for the super messy group of files, I tried to add all the relevant files required to look at my code/assets and run the macos build, 
but there were so many files that I couldn't add them all in their respective folders due to github's upload limits. That being said, my code is there 
to look at if needed!
